Board: STM32F407G Discovery Board

When making a project it can be beneficial to use libraries from STM32.
Libraries from STM32 can be found under the following directories on your computer: 

* C:\Users\username\STM32Cube\Repository\STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.28.0\Drivers\BSP\STM32F4-Discovery 
* C:\Users\username\STM32Cube\Repository\STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.28.0\Drivers\BSP\Components\lis3dsh

Above are two examples where you can find libraries for the discovery board and for the build-in accelerometer attached on the discovery board.
These libraries are very useful and can save some time.
